TODO/IDEAS

V1.0

Remove Spring dependency and only add it as new module(s)
-InVmDispatcher
	-Configurable executor. Prepare also to ForkJoinPool
-SpringInVmDispatcher (autowired, transactional, async)

Dispatcher implementations:
-Rest HTTP dispatcher
	-Annotations (jaxrs) could be used on commands to modify url and http method
	-URL should reflect to command and should contain resource ID for caching
		Example: 
			class GetDataCommand
				int dataId
			GET /rest/data/{dataId}
	-Cache headers
-Jms dispatcher
	-Implement as remote dispatcher and receiver
	-configurable message format
-SpringJmsDispatcher (jmstemplate)
-Load balancer dispatcher (uses an LB strategy to delegate to dispatcher instances)

Filters
	-Caching (how to use http cache header? or jms attributes. maybe result should have a header attribute which could travel in a protocol specific place)
	-Retry with retry policy
	-Circuit breaker
	-Logging
	-Monitoring (Command/Result logging, action execution time, jmx support)

V1.1

Action chaining concept. Should we allow this? A result of an action could be a CommandResult which contains the new command or we could use converters like in Camel.

Transaction usecases
-Run each command in separate transaction
-Run multiple commands in one transaction
-Run multiple in the same but one should commit anyhow (example: audit logging)

Command factory pattern for creating commands from different inputs (like rest parameters or camel message)

Akka integration

Camel integration
	-Camel dispatcher components. 
	-Command in the message body
	-Result could go to body or to header or just drop
	-Converter to make command from other types

Spring security integration
	Run as 
	Run as async (support for current user and other user too)
	RolesAllowed

Bulk dispatcher


Example implementation:
Rest interface
Jms, async and sync dispathing
Caching
Transaction handling (with error audit)
